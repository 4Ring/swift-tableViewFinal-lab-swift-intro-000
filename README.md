## Outline / Notes

![Planets](http://i.imgur.com/cqzETm8.png?1)

* I've included a complete Xcode project which they should be able to create from scratch.
* Step through the project and put together instructions for the student to complete.
* We can include an empty xcode project that has tests in it (similar to how this [lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/locationTrivia-TableViews) was setup in Objective-C.
* I think similar to that lab I referenced above, we should be testing the Planet class they make as well as testing the tableview they create, where KIF will tap on a cell and pass the info forward and make sure the subsequent VC is setup correctly displaying the info.
