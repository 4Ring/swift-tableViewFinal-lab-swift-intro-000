## Learning Objectives

* Complete this lab

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double, and Bool type.
* Can perform arithmetic operations on Int and Double.
* Understands if and else clause statements.
* Can create and use Arrays.
* Can iterate over an Array using a for-in loop.
* Can iterate over an Array calling enumerate().
* Work with the following methods on arrays:
	* append()
	* insert(_:atIndex:)
	* removeAtIndex()
	* subscript syntax with arrays
	* count
	* isEmpty
* Can work with dictionaries 
* Can iterate over a dictionary
* Knows how to work with optionals
* Classes
* Structs
* Properties

## Outline / Notes

![Planets](http://i.imgur.com/cqzETm8.png?1)

* I've included a complete Xcode project which they should be able to create from scratch.
* Step through the project and put together instructions for the student to complete.
* We can include an empty xcode project that has tests in it (similar to how this [lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/locationTrivia-TableViews) was setup in Objective-C.
* I think similar to that lab I referenced above, we should be testing the Planet class they make as well as testing the tableview they create, where KIF will tap on a cell and pass the info forward and make sure the subsequent VC is setup correctly displaying the info.
* I've installed KIF, Quick & Nimble through cocoapods. You're required then to open the .xcworkspace file (as is the student)
* I've been pulling the facts from this [site](http://space-facts.com/planets/), I like the idea of giving them general direction and having them supply this data themselves.
* Part of the instructions can include each planet with the necessary info below it here in the readme file and it's up to the studet ot copypaste it in when making Class objects in their initial view controller. Or maybe, we supply the array of facts per Planet and it's then on the student after initializing the planets to pass the necessary array into the intializer (that way the student isn't copy/pasting fact after fact). Open for ideas on this.
